summary: An introductory blog for a developer portfolio with code snippets in JavaScript and Python.
---

Welcome to my first blog post on my portfolio! This post serves as an introduction and a sample of the types of topics and code snippets Iâ€™ll be sharing here. If you're a developer or just interested in tech, stay tuned for more.

## Why a Portfolio Blog?

A portfolio blog is a great way to share knowledge, demonstrate skills, and document my journey as a developer. Expect posts on JavaScript, Python, frameworks like React, and backend tech like Node.js and MongoDB.

## Inline Highlighting

Here's a sample of inline code highlighting:

`const add = (num1, num2) => num1 + num2`

## Code Blocks

### JavaScript Code

Below is a small JavaScript snippet demonstrating a basic sum calculation:

```javascript
let num1, num2, sum;
num1 = prompt('Enter first number');
num2 = prompt('Enter second number');
sum = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2); // "+" means "add"
alert('Sum = ' + sum); // "+" means combine into a string
